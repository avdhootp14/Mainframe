# IBM JCL SORT Utility Assignment

This project demonstrates the use of IBM JCL (Job Control Language) to perform file handling, sorting, conditional execution, and error handling using the SORT utility and ICETOOL.

---

## üìù Problem Statement

Write a JCL job that:
1. Copies an input file (PS/PO) to an output file using the IBM SORT utility in descending order.
2. Compares the total number of records before and after the sort.
3. Keeps the output file only if the record counts match. If not, it should discard the output and print an error message.
4. Test and demonstrate both a success case and a fail case.

## üìÅ Files Structure

### ‚úÖ Success Case

These files demonstrate a working scenario where the input and output record counts match after sorting:

| File Name                    | Description                                  |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `SORTJOB1`                   | JCL job for the success case                 |
| `Z67429.JCL.SORTIN1`         | Input dataset for the success case           |
| `Z67429.JCL.SORTOUT1`        | Output dataset generated after sorting       |

---

### ‚ùå Fail Case

These files simulate a failure scenario where the input and output record counts **do not match** (e.g., due to duplicate or missing records):

| File Name                    | Description                                  |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `SORTJOB2`                   | JCL job for the failure case                 |
| `Z67429.JCL.SORTIN2`         | Input dataset containing duplicated records  |
| `Z67429.JCL.SORTOUT2`        | Output dataset that gets deleted and replaced with an error message |

## üí° Features Used

- SORT utility: To sort data in descending order.
- ICETOOL COUNT: To count records in input and output files.
- Conditional execution (COND): To control whether to keep or delete the output.
- IEFBR14: To delete the output file if counts do not match.
- IEBGENER: To write a custom error message in the output dataset if the job fails.

## ‚úÖ Output Behavior

- If record counts match, the output dataset will contain the sorted data.
- If record counts do not match, the output dataset will be deleted and replaced with the following error message:
