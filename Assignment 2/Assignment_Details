Steps involved - 


Step 1: Setting Up the Environment
Install and configure a COBOL development environment (e.g., IBM z/OS, VS Code with Zowe, or a mainframe emulator like Hercules).
Ensure access to a COBOL compiler (IBM Enterprise COBOL or GnuCOBOL for local testing).
Set up JCL execution capabilities using JES2/JES3 for running batch jobs.


Step 2: Creating Input Datasets
Define two Physical Sequential (PS) files:
File1: 50 records, 80 bytes each, with the primary key in columns 13-20.
File2: 50 records, 80 bytes each, with the primary key in columns 21-28.
Use ISPF or JCL to allocate these datasets on the mainframe.
Populate both files with sample data ensuring some matching and non-matching records.


Step 3: Writing the COBOL Program
Define file structures in the FILE SECTION of the COBOL program.
Implement the INPUT-OUTPUT SECTION to open, read, and process both files.
Extract and compare the primary keys from File1 and File2.
Store only matching records in an output file (File3).
Implement proper error handling for missing or malformed records.
Ensure sorted input for efficient processing.


Step 4: Creating the Output Dataset
Define File3, a PS file to store matching records.
Allocate the dataset using JCL.
Write the matching records from File1 and File2 into File3.


Step 5: Writing and Executing JCL
Write a JCL script to:
Allocate input and output datasets.
Compile and execute the COBOL program.
Sort input files using DFSORT (if needed).
Validate the output dataset.
